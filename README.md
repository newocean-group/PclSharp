# PclSharp
Point Cloud Library P/Invoke binding for C#

This project is a fork of the original PclSharp repository.

## Updates in this Fork
- Updated to compile successfully with **Visual Studio 2022**
- Added fixes for compatibility with modern toolchains
- Implemented missing features and improvements for **ICP (Iterative Closest Point)** functionality
- General stability and build fixes

## Original Notes
The original project used C# 7 features and required Visual Studio 2017 to build.  
This fork removes those limitations and supports newer development environments.
